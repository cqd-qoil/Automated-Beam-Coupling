# Counting-Card-Interface

Optimisation software for Quantum Optics Lab. Software architecture consists of Experiment which initialises and interfaces with hardware, an abstract class OptimizationAlgorithm, as well as a child implementation SimulatedAnnealing. Controller and DataBase classes have also been implemented for running the experiment and tracking/modeling information accordingly.
